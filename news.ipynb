Lets find out what the experts have to say about Indo-China relations.\", 'body': 'The General elections 2024 confirmed a comeback for prime minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government, infamously known as Modi 3.0. The new government, despite winning for a third consecutive term, has not had it easy. With growing tensions at the border and across the country, the centre of attention is the government&rsquo;s foreign policy, amid a new closeness between Russia and China. Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s policy on China has swung between talking and fighting for a decade. During his first term in 2014, Modi tried making peace with China but the relationship now stands tattered, as territorial and diplomatic clashes between the two countries, combined with the deadly Galwan Valley clashes that killed 20 soldiers, have only increased in the past decade. A decade of tensionsIn 2020, Chinese troops began the most brazen border violation by China in decades as they coordinated a campaign to move into disputed territories across the Line of Control that divides India and China. The troops began to occupy territories across the northern sector of the LAC that India had claimed and were soon in a standoff with the Indian Army. This lasted for two months, concluding with the deadly Galwan clashes that claimed the lives of 20 Indian jawans. The Galwan clashes effectively broke India&rsquo;s relationship with China. It did not take long for the territorial tensions to take an economic turn.India took several measures to cut its economic exposure to China. It aimed at creating everything China provided, locally. A series of bans happened, including Chinese companies and apps, most notably social media platform TikTok. The movement also barred Chinese companies from investing in some Indian firms, stopped them from bidding for road projects, and blocked a $3 billion import of power equipment.The PresentIn 2024, not much has changed. While the border crisis has eased in several hotspots, tens of thousands of troops remain deployed there. India has embarked on a major campaign to improve its infrastructure on the border with China. The country has been making serious decisions regarding tensions with China and the country has remained unpopular within the nation. Political dialogue has also been stalled since India has made it clear that China has to solve the border crisis before things can improve on our end. A steady future?Interestingly, there are signals that India may be considering a change in its approach to China. In an interview in April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India&rsquo;s relations with China were &ldquo;important and significant.&rdquo; Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also called for good relations with neighbours and stated that border talks with China were going well. There have been diplomatic developments on China&rsquo;s end too, as China finally appointed an ambassador to India. A number of experts also argue that reducing tensions and engaging with China might actually be a good idea as China has also repeatedly called for improvement in ties with India. However, China&rsquo;s proposal to fix relations isn&#039;t all in good taste, as China wants India to focus on other issues like economic and climate change instead of persisting over the border issue. On the economic front, despite several attempts to reduce dependence on China, trade with China has bloomed. In 2022, India-China trade crossed USD 136 billion, which made Beijing India&rsquo;s second-largest trade partner. Trade in electronics, pharmaceutical ingredients, textiles and chemicals has continued to bloom as India&rsquo;s economy still isn&#039;t full self-reliant on China. China is also the top supplier of goods to India&rsquo;s most important industrial sectors. The Modi government&rsquo;s efforts to block some of these imports have been met by protests from Indian businesses that need Chinese productsMeanwhile, India&rsquo;s electronics sector has pushed the government to allow more Chinese investment and joint ventures with Chinese firms. The industry has even asked for easier visa norms to allow Chinese technicians to help Indian electronics companies. They argue that if India is to become a developed country by 2047, its major industries will need investment and know-how from China.And from a diplomatic perspective, India is not alone in having tensions with China. The countries, however, have not isolated China.Clearly, India is not gaining much from being the only power that has isolated China. Both President Joe Biden of America and PM Albanese of Australia have met China&rsquo;s XI Jinping.Experts SayOn resolving issues with China, many of India&rsquo;s best experts have a nuanced answer. While they say that India has done well in holding its ground against China, it has also made clear again and again that China cannot break the rules and get away without consequences. Thus, these experts believe India&rsquo;s policy of holding back a full normalisation of relations until China behaves itself on the border is a sound strategy.China has a policy of undermining India in South Asia and has good relations with Indian rivals like Pakistan. Considering this, the experts also believe that India-China rivalry isn&#039;t going anywhere, despite more engagement or cooperation.

Now, there are five. Not only that. The US has an Indian-origin Vice-President, Kamala Harris, and a vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, with an Indian connection. Here are three big reasons behind the rise of Indian-origin politicians in the US.', 'body': 'In 2013, a solitary member represented Desis in the US House of Representatives. It was Ami Bera. No Indian-American politician had been elected to the Senate, and only a few Indian-origin legislators were part of the state Houses. In the span of a decade, the House of Representatives has seen five and the Senate one Indian-American member. Not just that, the Vice-President, Kamala Harris, is an Indian-origin woman.Then there is Nikki Haley, the Indian-origin former governor of South Carolina, who has run for the seat of President for the third time, this year. To top that, even the Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, JD Vance, has an Indian wife, which helps him gain the support of desires in the US. There are reasons behind the rise of Indian-Americans on the US political platform.The times have surely changed.Congress has sworn in five Indian-Americans. One has made it to the Senate and 50 Indian-Americans have been elected to the state legislature. Indian Americans represent 1% of the US population. Now, they also represent 1% of the US Congress.This is so far the best time for the Desis in American politics.1. RISE OF THE SECOND-, THIRD-GENERATION AND FUNDING  Indians began moving to the US in 1965 after an immigration law facilitating the migration of people was passed. Since then, Indians have gained wealth, better education and status in the US. This has led to a rise of second and third generation Desis in the US.Many advocacy groups such as Impact and the AAPI Victory Fund have facilitated the rise of Indians in US politics. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really all working in tandem,&rdquo; said Raj Goyle, a former state lawmaker in Kansas, who also helped establish Impact, told the New York Times. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a natural trend, society is more accepting, and there is deliberate political strategy to make it happen.&rdquo;&ldquo;It was inconceivable that someone named Raj Goyle — let alone Rajeev Goyle — would run for office in Wichita,&rdquo; he said. Today, &ldquo;the average voter&rsquo;s a lot more familiar with an Indian American face on TV, in their examining room, in their classroom, at their university, leading their company.&rdquo;Something like this would have been inconceivable to Dalip Singh Saund, who, in 1957, became the first Indian-origin politician to get elected to the House of Representatives. Saund was, in fact, the first Asian-American to be elected to the Congress.However, the Indian-American community would have to wait for more than 50 years to see another person from it get to the House of Representatives.It was only in 2004 that Bobby Jindal would represent a Congressional district in Lousiana, before becoming the governor of the state.Then came Ami Bera. When Bera was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012, he was only the third Indian-American to serve in Congress in its 224-year history, says a Forbes report.  2. HOW REPRESENTATION LEADS TO MORE REPRESENTATIONThe watershed moment came in 2016. Bobby Jindal, then the Governor of Louisiana, became the first Indian-American to run for the post of US President.That year, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Ro Khanna of California and Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois were also elected to the House of Representatives. In 2016, Kamala Harris became the first Indian-American to be elected to the Senate.Finally, in 2023, Shri Thanedar joined the Samosa Caucus of the four Representatives. Political experts believe this is a result of increasing representation. The more Indian-origin politicians became visible, the more were elected. It is a unique case of visibility and rise of a community.Indians, who by now had acquired wealth and standing in America society, were looking for posts of power. &ldquo;Within the Indian American community, political involvement wasn&rsquo;t really a high priority, because I think people were much more focused on establishing themselves economically and supporting their community endeavours,&rdquo; said Raj Krishnamoorthi, a Congressman from Illinois. With a growth in their affluence, the Samosa Caucus, the informal grouping of Indian-Americans in Congress, has only grown.3. HIGHLY EDUCATED AND COME FROM A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRYMany believe the core characteristics that Indians have led to their political ascendancy in the US.They are highly educated and very fluent in English. Indians are more fluent than many immigrants and this lowers their barriers of political engagement.They also come from a democracy, and they are more likely to engage with the democratic system than those who come from autocratic countries. These Indian-Americans have also done one more important thing. They have shown their rise and sold the dream of upward mobility and power for many Indians.&ldquo;Indian Americans really want to see more Indian Americans elected to office, and in the survey that we conducted, that was true even if it meant someone from another party,&rdquo; Professor Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of Politics, told the New York Times.What is more interesting to see is that Indian politicians now belong to both sides of the Democratic-Republican divide. The 2024 Republican presidential race witnessed two prominent Indian-Americans -- former Governor Nikki Haley and entrepreneur-politician Vivek Ramaswamy. Haley has also served as the US Ambassador to the United Nations.   As we see a big number of Indian-American politicians gain prominence in 2024, we need to remember that the three factors that played a key role in boosting their chances and would act as force multipliers in launching newer Indian-origin politicians. The party has just begun for the Samosa Caucus.

It was solidly in the 25-30% of GDP range during Dr. Manmohan Singh&#39;s tenure. Under the self-declared divinity, it has been squarely in the 20-25% of GDP range,&quot; Ramesh said.He said gross FDI as a percentage of GDP has also more or less stayed constant since 2014.&quot;This is, however, only part of the story. Since at least 2016, multinational companies across the world have been looking to divest from China and invest in other developing countries.&quot;India, with a large and growing labour pool, was at the right place at the right time but this generational opportunity to garner FDI and become a manufacturing and export-oriented economy has been squandered,&quot; Ramesh said.Countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam have walked away with the benefits, he said.&quot;Sops like corporate tax cuts and PLIs can&#39;t compensate for a freer society, polity, and economy one that is free from demonetization-like masterstrokes, cronyism, and Raid Raj,&quot; Ramesh said, hitting out at the Modi government.&quot;What India needs is not marginal policy tinkering, but a new, liberalised approach to political economy,&quot; the Congress leader said.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Budget for 2024-25 in the Lok Sabha on July 23.', 'source': 'Business Standard', 'date': '2024-07-17T10:17:03.000Z', 'props': {'type': 'website', 'title': 'India locked into low investment cycle, needs liberalised approach: Cong', 'url': 'https://www.business-standard.com/politics/india-locked-into-low-investment-cycle-needs-liberalised-approach-cong-124071700443_1.html', 'description': 'The Congress on Wednesday claimed that India has been locked into a cycle of low investment since 2014 due to a combination of \"erratic policy, rampant cronyism, and the ED/IT/CBI raid raj\", and asserted that the country needs a new liberalised approach to political economy.', 'image': 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-03/26/thumb/featurecrop/400X400/1711431162-4434.jpg', 'image:width': '400', 'image:height': '400'}, 'language': 'EN', 'created_at': '2024-07-17T10:51:01.603Z', 'hostname': 'business-standard.com', 'id': '4671fe54145688f1295d7b141de39629'}, {'_score': 16.416359, 'title': 'India completes annual UN human rights review | Latest News India - Hindustan Times', 'link': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-completes-annual-un-human-rights-review-101721203858097.html', 'description': 'India became a party to the ICCPR in 1979 and has undergone three such reviews so far, the last being in 1997. | Latest News India', 'body': 'NEW DELHI: India successfully concluded its fourth periodic review by the UN Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in Geneva on Tuesday.The Human Rights Committee, comprising 18 independent experts, monitors the implementation of the ICCPR, reviews reports of all countries by conducting periodic reviews and make observations and recommendations.The Indian delegation, jointly led by Attorney General R Venkataramani and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, included secretary (West) Pavan Kapoor and senior officials from the ministries of women and child development, social justice and empowerment, electronics and information technology, minority affairs, external affairs, tribal affairs, home affairs.The rights and freedoms provided in the ICCPR are guaranteed under the Constitution and legislative and judicial framework, the external affairs ministry said.
